## Illustrated Workflow

**Step-by-step Process**:
1. Input soybean images 
2. Preprocess images using OpenCV and numpy.
3. Pass images through a trained deep learning model for feature extraction and trait analysis.
4. Extract other phenotypic parameters using OpenCV.                       
5. Generate yield predictions.
